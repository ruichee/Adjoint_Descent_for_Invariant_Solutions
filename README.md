# Adjoint Descent for Invariant Solutions of Chaotic Systems
This repository includes scripts implementing the adjoint method proposed by M. Farazmand (2015). It is used to find invariant solutions of dynamical systems. In this project, we seek equilibria solutions to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky Equation through the adjoint descent method. This particular nonlinear equation contains spatial-temporal dynamics and exhibits chaotic behaviour.
The adjoint method allows us to find unstable equilibria solutions, giving us insight into the recurrent behaviour and patterns in chaotic and turbulent dynamics.
This code is developed as part of an undergraduate research project.
